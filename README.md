# Blog API
> Fast-API is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs Python-based on standard Python type hints.

### Dependencies:
- Python3.10
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL

> Notes: The following steps will walk you thru installation on a Mac. Linux should be similar. It's also possible to develop on a Windows machine, but I have not documented the steps. If you've developed the app on Windows, you should have little problem getting up and running.
